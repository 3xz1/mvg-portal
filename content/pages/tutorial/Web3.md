The Web3 is a mesh network of blockchains and smart contracts that interact with each other, and that form a new layer on top of the current internet. Web3 is an awesome new space because it has no central point, no owners, and no borders.

It’s called Web 3.0 because it’s an evolution of the internet since its beginning. The Web3 internet is built on fundamentally different infrastructure, utilizing blockchains and distributed peer-to-peer networks, compared to the current existing internet which relies on server-client relationships.

The Web 3.0, or Web3, of the 20’s allows for full liberalization of networks, removing the need for central intermediaries. Just like TCP/IP are communication protocols that define how information is sent between clients and servers over the Web, Ocean Protocol is a protocol that defines how data assets are exchanged in Web3.

**In Web3, anyone is free to transact without limits**. Anyone can buy, sell, trade in existing markets, and create new markets. We will see in the next chapters how Ocean Protocol makes this easy for the data and analytics markets.

**A decentralized computer**. We mentioned earlier that Ethereum adds the capability to execute programs on its blockchain. This effectively makes it a cloud computer that is owned by none and maintained by an open-source community. Everyone can deploy a program and everyone can execute it according to its rules. An independent piece of software code. This is called a smart contract. But we should not assume that this computer is efficient enough to do actual calculations. The execution speed is rather slow and expensive. This new computer does not replace cloud computers but enables a new infrastructure to utilize our resources in new ways. It enables novel approaches to deal with data, computation, and operate a business.
