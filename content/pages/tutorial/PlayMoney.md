title: Get play money
chapter: 3
---

**Get play money from a faucet**. Faucets are places where it’s possible to get tokens for free. Usually, they hand play money, basically tokens that have no market value. Many developers use faucets to start building apps in a safe and free environment before launching them on the main network.

**We will use a faucet on the Gaia-X test network**. The entire testnet uses play money, so the fees paid for transacting on the network do not represent any real financial value.

`TODO: RPC`

Go to MetaMask and select “Gaia-X Test Network” in the upper central dropdown list.

Go to the [Ocean faucet](link) and follow the instructions provided.

You will be asked to post your ETH address on Twitter or Facebook; the faucet providers do this to ensure that people can do this just once and don’t empty the faucet too quickly.

Copy your ETH wallet address by clicking on ‘Account 1’, the default account created by Metamask. Clicking will automatically copy your wallet address to the clipboard. You can safely share this address with anyone because it is public and it does not control your funds (with your set-up only your Metamask and your seed phrase can control your funds).

Paste your ETH wallet address into a new tweet and post it publicly. Being kind is optional but recommended :)

**You can also view the transaction on the blockchain** if you search for your wallet address via the dedicated Gaia-X [Blockchain explorer](https://blockscout.gaiaxtestnet.oceanprotocol.com). Blockchain explorers are public tools (usable by anyone) that allow people to search through the blockchain and check all transactions. If you have a spare minute go there and have a look, it’s nice to see ones’ transactions make history!
