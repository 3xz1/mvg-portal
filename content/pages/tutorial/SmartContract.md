A Smart Contract is a program that runs on a distributed computer. When people agree to use a smart contract, the program will perform the given action it was programmed to do if agreed conditions are met. This saves time, money, and limits conflicts when doing business with others.

A Smart Contract is a program that automatically performs transactions based on predetermined conditions, exactly as agreed. “If a transaction was received, access is granted”.

Smart contracts are especially useful for managing data workflows across people, teams, and companies, because they run in a way that is 100% deterministic. This means that once the smart contract is deployed, it will run exactly as agreed when the conditions are triggered.

**Vending machine example**. A Smart Contract could make some data available (transaction) once a payment was received (predetermined condition), regardless of its source (accessible by anyone). Such a contract could be called a “data vending machine”. This smart contract will always deliver access to the data if it has received a payment. It does not matter when or where the buyer is located and who that person is. You can get your data seamlessly through this contract, and that can come handy if you happen to work late at night on an analysis due in the morning. Just “pay and play”.

**Verifiability**. The agreement in the smart contract, its trigger conditions, and the operations it does are all publicly verifiable on the blockchain. In our previous example, everyone can track if and how the data was accessed and verify that the access condition(s) were met. This is made simple thanks to blockchain technology: the blockchain stores all transaction(s) related to all smart contracts, providing cryptographic proof of everything that happened.
